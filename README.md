## AspectJ
Spring AspectJ AOP implementation provides many annotations:

* `@Aspect` declares the class as aspect.
* `@Pointcut` declares the pointcut expression.

The annotations used to create advices are given below:

* `@Before` declares the before advice. It is applied before calling the actual method.
* `@After` declares the after advice. It is applied after calling the actual method and before returning result.
* `@AfterReturning` declares the after returning advice. It is applied after calling the actual method and before returning result. **But you can get the result value in the advice.**
* `@Around` declares the around advice. It is applied before and after calling the actual method.
* `@AfterThrowing` declares the throws advice. It is applied if actual method throws exception.

示例中：
* `UserServiceAspect`是对方法的切面处理
* `SysLogAspect`是对注解的切面处理
